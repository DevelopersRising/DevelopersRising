# Guidelines for the workshop on November 10th 2017

- Agree with your team on what to accomplish (the meetup organisers will help you with this)
- Based on what you decided to accomplish, divide the work across all team members, not leaving anyone out (unless they expressly want to)
- Define a project manager, who will have admin rights for the repository on GitHub
- Start working on your defined tasks. You can
  - work in pairs (or more)
  - work alone
  - only watch and learn
- When you have finished a task, open a pull request to the repository (the project manager will merge the branch)

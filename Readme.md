## Helping Developers

Our current focus for helping developers is centered around our meetups. A meetup is an event, usually happening monthly on evenings during weekdays. Join a meetup to watch live talks, get inspired, connect with like-minded learners and companies looking to hire, or to socialize in a casual setting.

Our talks are centered around programming and related topics, and given by members in the community - from beginners to seasoned veterans. Feel free to approach us if you are interesting in giving a talk.

# Social Media Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of maintaining and managing a social media presence is mainly twofold:

1. Provide multiple channels for communication;
   1. asynchronous between members, collaborators and the organization
   1. to spread information from the organization to it's members and collaborators
1. To build a presence online which potentially allows us to reach more developers and collaborators, in the following ways:
   1. following and engaging with social media profiles within the broad interest topics of "developers" and "programming"
   2. to share interesting content that we believe will engage or benefit the wider developer community

This document will mainly cover point 2a and 2b above.

## Strategy for social media management

Our strategy follows our code of conduct, and thus aims to be inclusive, kind, harassment-free, and cooperative. Keep this in mind while managing our social media presence.

Each social media platform has it's different culture and ways of doing things. We've thus divided this section into one sub-section per platform.

### Twitter

The basis for our Twitter strategy is to follow, within reason, as many local and international developers (and interesting profiles in the developer space) as possible. Part of our content strategy is then to retweet interesting tweets from these profiles, as well as keeping a regular eye on Twitter's [Highlights section](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172652) and like and retweet what looks like it could be of interest to our community.

We also strive to always share online content we come across with a descriptive and/or engaging tweet body and pictures where possible. This can be content such as articles, blog posts, videos, talks, resources, etc.

Hashtags can be included and should be relevant to our topics and community only (no #followfriday #retweetme etc). Suggested hashtags: #webdev #javascript #frontend #backend #code #learntocode #developers #programming ...
